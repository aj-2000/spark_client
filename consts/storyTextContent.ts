  "We are 4 college students with a shared vision to start a global homemade food delivery service. Our journey started at our PG where we all stayed together and everyone used to face a common issue of food quality. Nobody enjoyed their meals as they all missed the homemade essence in their food. So One-day Kashish and Saksham tried something new by cooking their own food and shared it with their friends Parth and Tushar, all of them enjoyed it very much and then a thought came to their mind that a lot of students might be facing the same problem, so they shared the food with everyone in their pg and recieved great responses. Then they expanded it and ended up getting orders from various pgâ€™s and nearby localities as well and like this, they got a really big database of consumers who want to have good and healthy home-made meal. Now they want to take their business to a higher level for which they need a lively website.";
